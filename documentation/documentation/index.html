        <h3 id="ins">1. Installation</h3>
        
        <p>To get the latest source JAR file, please refer to the <a href="../download">download</a> page. The licencing and technical
           features are also listed in the download page.
        To execute the application, <a href="http://java.com/en/download/">JRE 6</a> or higher needs
        to be installed on your machine. Prior to the execution, following additional requirements need to be met:
       </p>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="http://isophonics.net/nnls-chroma/">NNLS chroma vamp plugin</a> 0.21 or higher needs to be installed on your machine.
</li>
<li><a href="http://vamp-plugins.org/">QM Vamp plugin set
</a> 1.7 or higher needs to be installed on your machine.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Please, use the links provided to install all the required software.</p>
        
        <h3 id="bas">2. Basic usage</h3>
        
        <p>Run the application by double-clicking the JAR file. In the tabbed environment, choose the desired functionality
            (chord transition tool, audio analysis tool, or other). In all cases, read through the instructions in the application
            window from up to down, so all steps are finished in order to get the results.</p>
        
        <h3 id="ctt">3. Chord transition tool</h3>
        
        <p>Make sure that a MIDI input device is connected to your machine. harmony-analyser application works with MIDI devices connected
            to the MIDI IN port on your soundcard, or USB port. If you don't have a MIDI input device, you can still use
            a virtual MIDI keyboard such as <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/man/man1/vkeybd.1.html">vkeybd</a> for Linux
            (make sure that the raw MIDI ports are available when using virtual keyboards) or just use the text input in Chord transition tool.
            By hitting capture you can record two chords. Alternative way is to insert the chord in the text feel in absolute format
            (e.g. <i>C3 E3 G3</i>) or relative format (e.g. <i>C E G</i>). The tool will calculate the harmony complexity of both chords and
            the transition complexity in between them.
        
        <h3 id="aat">4. Audio analysis tool</h3>
        <p>Choose the WAV file to analyse and the txt file in which you would want to have the output. Both should be available in the directory where
        the JAR file is located. To see the available plugins and their settings, click button "List plugins". The analysis can begin
        and you can proceed by clicking "Extract Chromas", "Extract Chords", "Analyze", or other buttons.</p>
        <p><i>Note: in version 1.0 the process can take a long time, because each chroma is taken into account, without smoothing.</i></p>
